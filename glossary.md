Bayesian methods
    analytical methodology that takes advantage of [Bayesian logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics)

homoscedastic
    the variance for each data point is the same for all values

likelihood
    the probability distribution of some observed data in terms of model parameters

maximum likelihood estimation
    the model and parameters that obtain the maximum of the likelihood function for the data

model dataset
    the data that arises from our mathematical model

normal distribution
    a probability distribution that is often used in the natural sciences to represent real-valued random variables, i.e. experimental measurements, also known as a Gaussian distribution

optimisation algorithm
    the process used to *try* and get the best agreement between our model and experimental datasets

parameters
    values within our mathematical model that may be changed

prior knowledge
    what we already know about our system before looking at our data, e.g., from other measurements of underlying physics/chemistry
