# Data Curation

After revieweing the vast amount of available literature on the topic(example [1], [2], and [3]), it is important to clearly state and define what is data curation in the context of science and, specifically, in the context of our course.  

Our definition of **data curation** is the effort to organize multi-modal data collected during an experiment with the purpose of making the data easy to find, understand and reproduce.

Data curation referes the complete process of collecting the files with all the data measured during the experiment, including the set of information that is available in lab notebooks or in the memory of scientists ans, more generically, all the actors involved in collecting, reducing and analyzing such data.

Data curation is part of the data management and also include data enrichment
