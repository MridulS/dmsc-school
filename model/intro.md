# Model-dependent Analysis

**Model-dependent analysis** is the process where a mathematical model is constructed that provides a {term}`model dataset` that would be observed, if our mathematical model precisely described the system.
The {term}`parameters` of this model are then optimised, using some {term}`optimisation algorithm` to obtain the best agreement between the model dataset and our measured experimental data. 
The use of model-dependent analysis is popular in neutron scattering analysis, however, before working with our simulated neutron data, we will look at some toy examples. 

[TODO]: A figure showing the "workflow" of model-dependent analysis.
