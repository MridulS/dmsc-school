# Thinking about data probabilistically

When we make a measurement, we can only obtain **estimate** the true value of thing that we are measuring. 
Alongside the measurement, we have some uncertainty about the measurement, for this summer school, we will assume that this uncertainty is accurate. 
Together, this means that our knowledge about the thing we are measuring can be represented as a normal distribution, centred on the estimate with a standard distribution of the uncertainty.
