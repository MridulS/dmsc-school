# How many Lorentzian functions?

:class: important
Consider the QENS data and model from earlier, your colleague suggests that there may be more than one diffusive pathway in the measured material.
Additionally diffusive motions can be shown with additional Lorentzian functions in the mathematical model. 

How would you go about investigating this, using a Bayesian method?
